# Pokemon-Battle-API


Here We have an application that lets the visitor click on the battle button to start a battle between 2 pokemon. 
The API consists of over 900 pokemon with names, images, and battle points. The selection is random, and the application
compares both Pokemon's points, and declares a winner. Have fun with your kids. For children learning numbers, you can
ask them which number is greater, and have them tell you who the winner is!
